/*
 * 1. A declaration can be done any number of times but definition only once.
 * 2. the extern keyword is used to extend the visibility of variables/functions.
 * 3. Since functions are visible throughout the program by default, the use of extern is not needed in function
 * declarations or definitions. Its use is implicit.
 * 4. When extern is used with a variable, itâ€™s only declared, not defined.
 * 5. As an exception, when an extern variable is declared with initialization, it is taken as the definition of the
 * variable as well.
